## Overview
### Project goal
Create an electrocardiogram with a heart-shaped LED indicator (that lights up according to the heartbeat) and process heartbeat data (sort and search).

### Project architecture
* An electronic assembly with a heart-shaped LED indicator.
* An Arduino program to detect heartbeats and make the LED indicator blink.
* A Processing program to acquire data from the Arduino and store it in a CSV.
* A C program (named HeXartCare) to process the acquired data and to change the blinking mode of the LED indicator (to change the parameters of the Arduino program).

### Repo Content
* **HeXartCare_Code:** The source code of the HeXartCare program.
* **HeXartCare_Exe:** HeXartCare Executables (Windows and Linux), Arduino LED program, Arduino heartbeat sensor program, Processing heartbeat data collector program (and all the files they need to work).
* **Project_Management:** Diagrams of the electronic assembly.
